# HelloWorld
My idea for my project is to make my own Discord bot. This is an idea I’ve had for about 6 years now and I think I now have the skills to do so. This would all be in text and there would be no type of GUI implemented, there would be numerous commands it could hold, such as a ranking/levels system, a way that you can ban people with a singular command, and a prune command (which would delete x amount of messages). The bot will read the user’s command and it will output their request.  

There will be numerous conditionals, loops, arrays, objects, and classes in this project as making a discord bot is not an overnight assignment. This project will take a lot of my personal time but I am willing to be devoted to making this bot as said previously, I have been wanting to do this for quite some time now. This project will require NodeJS, Visual Studio Code, Discord Developer Portal and the Discord API Permissions Calculator. I will use these when they are necessary and each one of these programs has its own defined task that is set to them, such as uploading the code and making it so the user can prompt the bot.  

This will definitely be a challenge and I use Discord on a typical day-to-day basis so it will definitely be something that I can use for productivity and I am looking forward to the struggles of this project and figuring out how to use some of these programs more effectively. I don’t think I will need any help from you at the beginning of the Discord bot programming, but as time progresses I might need some help.
